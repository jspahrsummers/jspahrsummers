## About me

Hi, I'm Justin! 👋

I'm currently doing independent game development as [**@fernforestgames**](https://github.com/fernforestgames).

Previously, I worked at [Anthropic PBC](https://anthropic.com), where I was involved in developing and launching the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Before that, I was at various other companies—notably Meta and GitHub—and did some independent consulting as well.

In a past life, I contributed significantly to some open source projects in the iOS and macOS ecosystem:
* [ReactiveCocoa](https://reactivecocoa.io/): reactive programming in Swift and Objective-C
* [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle): a model framework for Cocoa
* [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac): robust software update framework for Mac apps
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage): a decentralized dependency manager

I may not be able to respond to pings and reachouts—sorry in advance.
