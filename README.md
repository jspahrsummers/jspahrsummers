## About
I'm a seasoned software engineer and engineering manager with highly varied technical experience, including:

- Mobile and desktop development
- Full stack development
- Backend distributed systems
- Functional programming
- Reactive programming
- Programming language development and tooling
- Machine learning
- Financial automation
- Cryptocurrency/decentralized finance
- Unity game development

As an engineering manager and a technical lead, I emphasize coaching and mentoring, and sharing mental models to help everyone level up. I also care strongly about how companies and teams organize themselves and their work, and am deeply familiar with the common growing pains.

I've done a little bit of everything, and if there's something I haven't done before, I'll learn it.

**I'm available for remote contract work in various formats. Please email [justin@jspahrsummers.com](mailto:justin@jspahrsummers.com) and we can discuss more.**
