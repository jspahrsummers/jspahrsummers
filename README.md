## About me

Hi, I'm Justin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm very excited and very worried about the potential of AI, which is why I work at [Anthropic PBC](https://anthropic.com). I'm currently part of the team developing and maintaining the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). _Note that my opinions don't reflect those of my employer._

Previously, I worked at various other companiesâ€”notably Meta and GitHubâ€”and have done some independent consulting as well.

In a past life, I contributed significantly to some open source projects in the iOS and macOS ecosystem:
* [ReactiveCocoa](https://reactivecocoa.io/): reactive programming in Swift and Objective-C
* [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle): a model framework for Cocoa
* [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac): robust software update framework for Mac apps
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage): a decentralized dependency manager

I may not be able to respond to pings and reachoutsâ€”sorry in advance.
